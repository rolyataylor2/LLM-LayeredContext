# Project Outline: Modular Memory System for AI Agents

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to develop a modular memory system for AI agents that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and updating of context information. The memory system will be divided into 9 blocks, each representing a specific aspect of the agent's memory. Each block will contain static content, dynamic content, and an update script to facilitate seamless context generation and management.

## Methodology
1. Memory Block Structure:
   - Implement a structure for each memory block, consisting of:
     - Name of the block
     - Static Content: Provides the bot with information about the upcoming context
     - Dynamic Content: Contains updated or rewritten context information

2. Update Script:
   - Create an update script for each memory block that handles the updating of dynamic content.
   - Implement options for block updating, including:
     - Freezing the block to prevent updates
     - Running updates every (N) messages
     - Setting a maximum size for the block

3. Context Generation:
   - Develop a context generation process that utilizes the memory blocks to provide the bot with relevant information.
   - When generating context, include:
     - Name of the block
     - Static Content
     - Dynamic Content

4. Long-term Features:
   - Knowledge Repository Integration:
     - Design a system to connect each memory block to a knowledge repository.
     - Implement mechanisms for retrieving and updating information from the knowledge repository.
   - IoT Device Integration:
     - Develop a framework to connect memory blocks to real-world IoT devices.
     - Establish communication protocols for exchanging data between the memory blocks and IoT devices.

5. Example Memory Blocks:
   - Implement specific memory blocks for various purposes, such as:
     - Remembering facts about people
     - Tracking relationships with people
     - Long-term memory storage
     - Reaction/temperament modeling
     - Identity definitions
     - Task tracking
     - Visualization block for visualizing the agent itself or other relevant information

6. Documentation and Examples:
   - Create comprehensive documentation explaining the usage and configuration of the modular memory system.
   - Provide easy to use, end user interface demonstrating how to integrate the memory system into AI agents.

## Repository Structure
- `src/`: Contains the source code for the modular memory system
  - `memory_blocks/`: example memory blocks
- `examples/`: Provides example complete agents
- `docs/`: Contains documentation and tutorials for using the modular memory system
- `app.html`: Complete user interface, user must provide api key, no information is sent to 3rd parties.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project and instructions for getting started

By following this project outline, we aim to develop a robust and extensible modular memory system that enhances the context awareness and performance of AI agents.
